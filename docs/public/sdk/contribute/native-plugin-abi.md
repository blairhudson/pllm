The installed native module is currently built with PLLM. A stable third-party native plugin ABI is not published.

Any future ABI must version ownership, allocation, byte layout, alignment, panic isolation, threading, cancellation, capability negotiation, artifact identity, host-feature detection, and error translation. Python entry points must remain lightweight and side-effect-free during discovery.

## Python SDK example

```python
from pllm.kernels import Cpu

print(Cpu.describe().distribution)
```

This discovers the built-in distribution only. No third-party native plugin ABI is published.
