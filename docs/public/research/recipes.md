A recipe records exact sources, method and component versions, model and workload
limits, environment requirements, steps, expected files, evidence, and failure
policy. Listing a recipe never runs it.

Recipes support reproducibility without making third-party repositories runtime
dependencies. PLLM implements methods independently in Python and Rust. Original
artifacts remain sources and comparison material only.

Use the pages in this section and the [research backlog](/research/backlog/) to
inspect current workflows. Recipe execution is not supported because sandboxing,
artifact identity, and result records are not yet available together.

Use the pages in this section to choose a workflow. Build and reproduction work
must stop rather than silently substituting an upstream runtime, weakening the
privacy boundary, or presenting unmatched measurements as comparable evidence.
