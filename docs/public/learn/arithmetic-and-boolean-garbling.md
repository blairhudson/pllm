Arithmetic garbling works with modular integer values. Boolean garbling works
with bit-level circuits, often using half-gates and free-XOR-compatible labels.
Lookup tables and weighted paths are ways to represent a computation; they do not
provide identical protocol or security guarantees.

Moving values between arithmetic and Boolean forms changes range, bit width,
truncation, and communication requirements. A fast primitive does not make a
complete transformer executable. Correct reference code is also not a substitute
for cryptographic review.

Read [garbling protocols](/sdk/pipeline/protocols/garbling/) and
[conversions](/sdk/build/conversions/) for the exact interfaces and current limits.
